### Features

The following are some of the features of this project:

- Uses [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for state management
- Uses [Async Thunks](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk) in redux slices for handling API requests
- Uses [MirageJS](https://miragejs.com/) as a fake API for the app
- CI/CD pipeline with Github Workflows
- Completely typed with Typescript
- Completely interactive and responsive design with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) components.

### Learning Outcomes

The following are some of the learning outcomes of this project:

- Using [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for state management
- Creating an API mocking server with [MirageJS](https://miragejs.com/)
- Separating API calls from components making them more readable and concise using [Async Thunks](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk) in slices
- Using [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview) to create forms without boiler plate code
- Using [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for form validation in a concise and declarative way
- Using Typescript to develop a typed web app
- Building a web app with React.JS, [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) etc.
